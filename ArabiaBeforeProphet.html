        <div class="lead"><p>Economically, the Jewish people were the leaders of Arabia. They were the owners of the best arable lands and were the best farmers in the country. They were also the entrepreneurs of such industries as existed in Arabia in those days
.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Slavery was an economic institution of the Arabs. Male and female slaves were sold and bought like animals, and they formed the most depressed class of the Arabian society.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The most powerful class of the Arabs was made up by the capitalists and money-lenders. They charged exorbitant rates of interest on loans, which made them richer and richer, and the borrowers poorer and poorer.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The most important urban centres of Arabia were Mecca and Yathrib.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The citizens of Mecca were mostly merchants, traders and money-lenders.
&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">Their caravans travelled in summer to Syria and in winter to Yemen.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">They also travelled to Bahrain in the east and to Iraq in the northeast.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The caravan trade was basic to the economy of Mecca, and its organization called for considerable skill, experience and ability.</span></p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p><strong>Polytheists:</strong>&nbsp;Most of the Arabs worshipped numerous idols and each tribe had its own deity and idols. They had about 360 idols of stone and wood in Kaaba in Mecca.</p><p><strong>Atheists:</strong>&nbsp;They were materialists and didn’t believe in any God.</p><p><strong>Zindiqs:</strong> They were influenced by the Persian doctrine of dualism in nature and believed that there were two gods representing the twin forces of good and evil or light and darkness who were locked up in an unending struggle for supremacy.
</p><p><strong>Sabines:</strong>&nbsp;They worshipped the stars.
</p><p><strong>Jewish:</strong> They came to Arabia when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem and drove them out of Palestine and Syria in A.D. 70. Many Arabs under their influence converted to Judaism. Their strong centres were the towns of Yathrib, Khayber, Fadak and Umm-ul-Qura
</p><p><strong>Christians:</strong>&nbsp;In the north Arabian tribe of Ghassan were converted to Christianity by Romans. Some of their clans migrated and settled in Hijaz. In the south Christians was originally brought by the Ethiopian invaders. Their strong center was the town of Najran.
</p><p><strong>Monotheists: </strong>There was a small group of monotheists present in Arabia. They were the followers of the Prophet Abraham and didn’t worship idols.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="lead"><p>Among the Arabs there were extremely few individuals who could read and write. Most of them were not very eager to learn these arts. 
<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The culture of the period was almost entirely oral and the Jews and Christians were the custodians of such knowledge.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The greatest intellectual accomplishment of the pagan Arabs was their poetry.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">The greatest compositions of the pagan Arabs were called “Golden Odes,” a collection of seven poems, supposedly of unsurpassed excellence in spontaneity, power and eloquence. They were suspended in Kaaba as a challenge to any aspiring genius to excel or to match them. &nbsp;</span></p><p>These poems had beauty of the language and wild richness but the subject of the poet was limited.
</p><p>The popular themes were the charm of his mistress, his generosity and prowess, the unrivalled glory of his tribe, the noble qualities of his camel
, s<span style="font-size: 1.07rem;">ome of them only added fuel to the besetting vices of the people, vainglory, envy, vindictiveness and pride</span></p></div>
